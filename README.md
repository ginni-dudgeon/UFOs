# UFOs

Use of JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap

Overview:


The purpose of this project is to visually display data regarding UFO sightings. The data was contained in a JavaScript array and was quite messy. The client asked for a website showing the data along with filters that allows one to sort through the data. This project required the use of JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap.

Results:


The website allows for 5 filters. The filters are located on the left-hand side of the page. These include date, city, state, country and shape. To use the search function, simply type in the desired dates, city, state, country and shape and it will return the desired fields. The search fields can be reset by clicking on “UFO Sightings” located at the top of the page on the left-hand side.

Summary:


One drawback of this page is its functionality. It is an attractive page; however, the search function is vague, and it is not apparent how to use it at first. This could be difficult for users to navigate

One recommendation to improve the page would be to install a drop-down feature when inputting search items into the filters. This could make the search feature more user friendly. Another recommendation would be to include more search parameters that might make it easier to find what one is looking for.
